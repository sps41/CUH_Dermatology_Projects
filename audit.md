## Audit Projects

**Title:** Non-pigmented lesion referral <br>
**Clinician responsible:** Dr Stephen Smith <br>
**Aim:** To audit the quality and appropriateness of referrals for non-pigmented skin lesions  <br>
**Description:** Anecdotally a large proportion of patients referred to secondary care for review of non-pigmented lesions do not appear appropriate to clinicians in the hospital setting. Inappropriate referrals are expensive and burden both patients and the healthcare system. Reducing inappropriate referrals is a crucial element of efficient clinical practice. Quantifying the problem (if it is real) will allow a cost estimate to be placed on the burden of inappropraite referrals and will allow for some direction of resources to ameliorate the problem. <br>
*Methods:* 1. Summarise national and international guidelines on non-pigmented lesions that should be referred to secondary care  <br>
2. Identify a series of 200 patients seen in clinic referred for review of a non-pigmented lesion (EPIC query) <br>
3. For each case identify the referral data given, final diagnosis and the hopsital action taken <br>
4. Describe the proportions referred who met or did not the criteria identified in 1. <br>
5. Recommend actions (if needed) to improve adherence to the guidelines <br>
6. Present findings and recommendations for action (written and oral presentations, publication) <br>
7. Assist or direct implementation of 6. <br>
8. Re-audit after appropraite period (6 months, 12 months, 2 years)

**Title:** Audit diagnosis of BP in CUH <br>
**Clinician responsible:** Dr Stephen Smith <br>
**Aim:** To audit the diagnostic tests used for suspected bullous pemphigoid in CUH  <br>
**Description:** See [clinical projects page](/Clinical_Projects.md/) for background. <br>
*Methods:* 1. Summarise national and international guidelines on diagnosis of BP  <br>
2. Identify a series of 50 patients with both BP antigen and diagnostic biopsy results (positive or negative; EPIC query), 100 patients with either result and 100 patients with a diagnosis of BP (there will be overlap) <br>
3. For each case identify the results, test concordance and final diagnosis <br>
4. Describe the proportions referred who met or did not the criteria identified in 1. <br>
5. Recommend actions (if needed) to improve adherence to the guidelines <br>
6. Present findings and recommendations for action (written and oral presentations, publication) <br>
7. Assist or direct implementation of 6. <br>
8. Re-audit after appropriate period (6 months, 12 months, 2 years) <br>
9. Feed rslts back into clinical project by providing diagnostic test accuracy statistics and cost-of-disease paramaters.
