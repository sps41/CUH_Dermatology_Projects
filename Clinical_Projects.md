**Title:** Surgical wound healing <br>
**Clinician responsible:** Dr Marc Wallace <br>
**Aim:** To create a database of pre and post photos of surgery for patients to understand how removal of various lesions might evolve at points up to 1 year  <br>
**Description:** Create a database of pre and post photos of surgery potentially using patient supplied post op images and automated MyChart reminders at set intervals ultimately to be used as an online resource  <br>

**Title:** Visual guide to quantity of steroid used for various body sites <br>
**Clinician responsible:** Dr Marc Wallace<br>
**Aim:** To create a visual guide to quantity of steroid used for various body sites  <br>
**Description:** visual guide to quantity of steroid used for various body sites  <br> 

**Title:** Emollient weight calibration <br>
**Clinician responsible:** Dr Marc Wallace <br>
**Aim:** To quantitavely investigate the dispensing weight of emollients from different brands  <br>
**Description:** Experiment to weigh how much emollient in g is dispensed from one pump on average of each brand of emollient to see how they correlate.   <br>

**Title:** Bullous pemphigoid diagnosis <br>
**Clinician responsible:** Dr Stephen Smith <br>
**Aim:** To determine the most clinically and cost effective test for diagnosing bullous pemphigoid  <br>
**Description:** Current clinical practice requires biopsy of suspected BP lesions despite the high reported sensitivity and specificity of BP antigen testing (available in the community). Diagnosis and treatment of suspected BP is expensive and slow at present. A series of linked projects would allow this to be quantified and may feed into NICE/BAD guidance on managing BP. NB: this is a series of linked projects which would not need to all be undertaken by the same person. <br>
*Methods* 1. Audit diagnosis of BP in CUH (see [audit page](/audit.md) <br>
2. From 1 calculate the NPV/PPV/accuracy of BP antigen vs diagnostic biopsy <br>
3. From 2 calculate a health economic analysis of using either or both tests for diagnosing BP <br>
4. Summarise and compare the clinical and system impacts of diagnostic strategies (and downstream treatment) for BP.
