## Projects at CUH Dermatology

This site is a repository of projects available or suggested in the department of Dermatology at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust. It includes audits, quality improvement projects, clinical research projects (small and focused), interesting clinical cases that might warrant publication or presentation and educational projects relevant to dermatology. To add a project either edit the source code if you know how, or contact Steve Smith with a summary to get it added. If you're interested in taking on a project get in touch with the clinician named in the individual project descriptions.
