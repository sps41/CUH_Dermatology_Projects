# Projects at CUH Dermatology


This site is a repository of projects available or suggested in the department of Dermatology at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust. It includes [audits](/audit.md/), [quality improvement projects](/QIP.md/), [clinical research projects](/Clinical_Projects.md/) (small and focused), [interesting clinical cases](/case_reports.md/) that might warrant publication or presentation and [educational projects](/meded.md/) relevant to dermatology. To add a project either edit the source code if you know how, or contact Steve Smith with a summary to get it added.
